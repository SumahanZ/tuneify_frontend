# Tuneify

Tuneify is a project where you can listen to songs, and save them to a playlist, along with other functionalities. The main tech stack for Tuneify will be separated into the front end and the back end. Flutter and the Riverpod State Management and Clean Architecture will be used for the front-end tech stack. Afterward, the tech stack for the back-end will be built using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js, along with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
